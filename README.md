# I am rich

A simple flutter app that displays a nice looking diamond on your display. This was meant as a test, so that's pretty much all there is. 

## Install instructions
You'll have to clone and build this app locally to test it at this time. For this you'll need the Flutter SDK, along with either the latest Android SDK or IOS SDK.
